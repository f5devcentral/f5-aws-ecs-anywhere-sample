   # TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   # 1. Definitions.

   #    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
   #    and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

   #    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   #    the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   #    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
   #    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
   #    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
   #    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   #    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   #    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   #    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   #    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   #    exercising permissions granted by this License.

   #    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   #    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   #    source, and configuration files.

   #    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   #    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   #    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   #    and conversions to other media types.

   #    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   #    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   #    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   #    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   #    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   #    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   #    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   #    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   #    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   #    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   #    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   #    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   #    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   #    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   #    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   #    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   #    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   #    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   #    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   #    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   #    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   #    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   #    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   #    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   #    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   #    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   #    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   # 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   #    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   #    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   #    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   #    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   #    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   # 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   #    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   #    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   #    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   #    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   #    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   #    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   #    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   #    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   #    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   #    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   #    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   #    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   #    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   #    as of the date such litigation is filed.

   # 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   #    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   #    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   #    meet the following conditions:

   #    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
   #        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   #    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
   #        stating that You changed the files; and

   #    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
   #        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
   #        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
   #        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
   #        the Derivative Works; and

   #    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
   #        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
   #        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
   #        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
   #        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   #        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   #        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   #        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
   #        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
   #        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   #        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   #        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   #        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   #        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   #        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   #        as modifying the License.

   #    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   #    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   #    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   #    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   #    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   #    the conditions stated in this License.

   # 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   #    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   #    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   #    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   #    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   #    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   #    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   # 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   #    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   #    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   #    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   # 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   #    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   #    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   #    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   #    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   #    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   #    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   #    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   #    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   # 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   #    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   #    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   #    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   #    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   #    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   #    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   #    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   #    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   #    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   #    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   # 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   #    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   #    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   #    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   #    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   #    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   #    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   #    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   #    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   #    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   # END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
